# Introduction

Sirius is an open-source **Plonkish Folding Framework** for Incrementally Verifiable Computation [[IVC](https://iacr.org/archive/tcc2008/49480001/49480001.pdf)].

Within the context of an IVC scheme, the prover's role is to demonstrate that, upon consecutively applying a step function `F` exactly `n` times to an initial value $z_0$, the result is $z_n$. Here, the step function `F` takes two inputs $z_i$ and $w$, and yields an output $z_{i+1}$.

# Architecture

The `Sirius` folding framework is designed with a three-tiered architecture.

- **Arithmetization Layer**: This layer serves as the interface of the constraint system. User-defined circuits and witness data are converted into an intermediate representation format defined by the folding scheme. Our current implementation follows the _special-sound interactive protocol_ (SPS) from [Protostar](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/620).
- **Folding Scheme Layer**: At the heart of the framework is the folding scheme IVC circuit that accumulates the computations of multiple steps. At each step, the prover first calculates the instance-witness pairs from the previous step and folds them into the accumulator, then computes the cross terms and error vector for the folded instance-witness pairs. An IVC circuit then takes the outputs from the prover and performs the following steps: apply the step function `F`, fold the previous step's instance into the accumulator instance, and verify the inputs of the IVC circuit.
- **SNARK Layer**: The SNARK layer leverages Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs (PIOP) and Polynomial Commitment Schemes (PCS) to generate zkSNARKs for succinct and zero-knowledge verification. Polynomial relation checks of the IVC decider are converted to the _multivariate sum-check protocol_. The evaluation phase of the sum-check protocol depends on the polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) we choose, e.g. [Hyrax](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1132.pdf). It is worth noting that when the polynomials are sparse, we can use the Spark compiler from [Spartan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550) to handle them efficiently.

# Getting Started
```rust
/// To allow your circuit to be folded, impl this trait
/// `ARITY` - size of input & output
pub trait StepCircuit<const ARITY: usize, F: PrimeField> {
    type Config: Clone;
    fn configure(cs: &mut ConstraintSystem<F>) -> Self::Config;
    /// This method represents step function `F: z_i -> z_{i+1}`
    ///
    /// Unlike `halo2::Circuit`, it takes array of assigned cells
    /// and returns array of assigned cells
    fn synthesize_step(
        &self,
        config: Self::Config,
        layouter: &mut impl Layouter<F>,
        z_in: &[AssignedCell<F, F>; ARITY],
    ) -> Result<[AssignedCell<F, F>; ARITY], SynthesisError>;
}
```
