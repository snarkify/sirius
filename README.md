<h1 align="center">Sirius</h1>

A plonkish folding scheme based on [halo2](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2).

>Sirius, renowned as the most luminous star in the night sky,
> deceives the naked eye by appearing as a solitary point of light when,
> in fact, it is a binary star system. Inspired by this duality,
> our project bears the name Sirius, capturing the essence of folded instances
> that give the illusion of being a singular entity.
