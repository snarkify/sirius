/// The `StepCircuit` trait represents a step in incremental computation in
/// Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC).
///
/// # Overview
/// - The trait is crucial for representing a computation step within an IVC
///   framework.
/// - It provides an abstraction for handling inputs and outputs efficiently
///   at each computation step.
/// - The trait should be implemented by circuits that are intended to represent
///   a step in incremental computation.
///
/// # API
/// Design based on [`halo2_proofs::plonk::Circuit`] and
/// [`nova::traits::circuit`](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova/blob/main/src/traits/circuit.rs#L7)
///
/// # `const ARITY: usize`
/// The number of inputs or outputs of each step. `synthesize` and `output`
/// methods are expected to take as input a vector of size equal to
/// arity and output a vector of size equal to arity.
///
/// # References
/// - For a detailed understanding of IVC and the context in which a trait
///   `StepCircuit` might be used, refer to the 'Section 5' of
///   [Nova Whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/969.pdf).
///   This trait is representation of `F` function at 'Figure 4'
///     - `F` is a polynomial-time function that takes non-deterministic input. It is the function
///       that represents the computation being incrementally verified. In the context of IVC, each
///       step of the incremental computation applies this function FF.
/// - For `F'` please look at [`StepCircuitExt`]
